# Xerg

Find wasted AI spend in OpenClaw, Hermes, QM, Claude Code, Cursor, and any framework that can export a JSON event payload.

Xerg is a local-first CLI for auditing AI spend in dollars, not raw token counts. It reads OpenClaw logs/transcripts or an independent sanitized trace capture, Hermes v0.17+ `state.db` with optional observer/certified trace enrichment, QM snapshots, Claude Code transcripts, and Cursor usage exports — plus event payloads from any framework via `xerg ingest` — separates three evidence-strict monetary findings from seven neutral signals, reports what each detector assessed, and lets you measure compatible fixes with `--compare`.

Everything runs locally by default. The CLI is publicly installable from npm as `@xerg/cli`, but it is not open source. No account is required for local audits. A free hosted workspace keeps the last 30 days of pushed audits; hosted MCP requires a Pro or Enterprise workspace.

The `npx @xerg/cli@latest` path fetches and executes the published npm package before running Xerg. If you want to avoid that fetch on each use, install the CLI globally with `npm install -g @xerg/cli`.

## Install

Give a terminal-capable agent the universal cold-fetch prompt:

```text
set up https://xerg.ai/skill.md
```

The agent must ask before persistent installation, runs `doctor`, and offers a local audit before any upload.

Install this skill into any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others):

```bash
npx skills add xergai/skills
```

Then ask your agent to audit your AI spend. The agent runs the CLI itself and explains the findings.

Install the CLI directly:

```bash
npm install -g @xerg/cli
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx @xerg/cli@latest init
```

## What It Finds

- **Retry waste** from stable charged failed/aborted attempt chains ending in success
- **Tool-loop waste** from exact no-progress tool input/result/state repetitions
- **Cache churn** only when a cache lifecycle costs more than its uncached counterfactual
- Seven separate neutral signals for deep loops, context outliers/growth, fixed cadence, premium-model routine labels, cache-read concentration, and Max Mode concentration

Current JSON findings carry affected and avoidable spend, evidence and impact bases, and detector version. Signals carry bounded observed metrics plus optional associated spend and basis; associated spend is never classified as waste. Compare output reports monetary deltas only when active-finding coverage is compatible.

Claude Code streaming records are reconstructed before analysis. Repeated tool-name chains are reported as neutral argument-diversity evidence, with only SHA-256 input/result digests and byte counts retained locally. A high distinct-input ratio is consistent with fan-out, while a low ratio is a reason to inspect; neither creates avoidable spend. Use `xerg explain <item-id>` to inspect a saved finding, signal, or chain packet.

## Quick Start

Interactive first run (humans):

```bash
xerg init
xerg audit --compare
```

Non-interactive path (agents, scripts, CI):

```bash
npx --yes @xerg/cli@latest doctor --json
xerg audit --json
xerg audit --json --compare
xerg collect openclaw
xerg collect hermes --state-db ~/.hermes/state.db
xerg doctor --runtime qm
xerg audit --runtime qm --since 7d
xerg audit --otlp-file ./openclaw.capture.jsonl
```

Add `--runtime openclaw`, `--runtime hermes`, or `--runtime claude-code` when more than one local runtime is detected. QM is never auto-detected and always uses `--runtime qm` after administrator setup.

## Sources

- Local machine: OpenClaw, Hermes, and Claude Code (`xerg audit --runtime claude-code`)
- Explicit QM source: host-independent `qm-snapshot/v1`, strict view-only direct PostgreSQL, or the certified Fly-contained exporter
- Independent local OpenClaw traces: `xerg collect openclaw` or `xerg audit --otlp-file <capture.jsonl>`
- Certified local Hermes trace enrichment: `xerg collect hermes --state-db <path>` or `xerg audit --runtime hermes --state-db <path> --otlp-file <capture.jsonl>`
- Local Cursor usage export: `xerg audit --cursor-usage-csv ./cursor-usage.csv`
- Any framework's exported event payload: `xerg ingest --file payload.json`
- Remote OpenClaw sources via SSH or configured remote transports

If local defaults are empty, inspect the target directly first with `xerg doctor --remote user@host`.

## Optional Hosted Follow-Up

```bash
xerg activate --push-latest
xerg mcp-setup
```

- `activate` offers browser approval and pushes the latest audit; add `--organization-id org_...` to require one exact Clerk workspace, or `--connect-only` to pair without auditing or pushing
- `mcp-setup` prints or writes hosted MCP config for supported clients
- local audits and compare remain available if you skip hosted setup

## Security And Data Flow

- Local audits read OpenClaw, Hermes, QM snapshots, Claude Code, Cursor usage, or ingest payload files and may write local JSON snapshots for `--compare`.
- Hermes uses `~/.hermes/state.db` read-only by default and as its sole monetary authority. Optional observer telemetry and certified trace enrichment preserve authoritative token buckets and `economicAuditId`; analysis `auditId` changes when coverage/findings change. Push v6 includes content-free finding/signal coverage plus eligible evidence-strict results; detailed mechanics remain local.
- QM currently supports one-shot snapshot, strict direct, and Fly-contained collection. Strict direct mode uses a dedicated export-view-only reader. Fly Managed Postgres instead uses a disclosed one-shot process boundary inside QM core and does not claim database least privilege. Both use a backed-up identity key and HMAC raw IDs before persistence; content fields are not exported, and `openrouter/auto` placeholders remain unpriced. A QM Slack agent can audit an authorized pre-created snapshot with an operator-provisioned exact CLI but cannot initiate live collection. Continuous follow capture, durable tool-history capture beyond QM's retention window, and live Slack-triggered collection are not currently supported. Current Fly Sprites require the CLI to be explicitly installed and verified inside the private persistent Sprite because they do not apply the configured sandbox OCI image.
- Both trace collectors bind only to loopback, sanitize before persistence, receive traces only, and never push automatically. `analysisCoverage`, `toolActivity`, and `workloadEconomics` remain local.
- Remote OpenClaw audits pull selected files to local temporary storage before analysis.
- Xerg Cloud sync only happens when you run `connect`, `audit --push`, or `push`.
- Push payloads include audit totals, rollups, findings, recommendations, comparison deltas, and source metadata. They exclude raw prompt and response content, local source file paths, local snapshot store paths, and internal finding details.
- Push v6 carries separate content-free findings, signals, per-detector coverage, and pricing coverage. Evidence references and internal details stay local.
- Local snapshots may contain versioned diagnostic packets with digests, byte counts, local paths, and inspection guidance. Raw or truncated tool arguments/results are never stored, and diagnostics, digests, paths, and per-TTL cache buckets never cross Push v6.
- Runtime costs may be observed, locally estimated, or unpriced. They are not authoritative provider invoices; Xerg does not currently ingest provider bills, reconcile invoices, or convert runtime audits to FOCUS.

## CI And Automation

```bash
xerg audit --push --fail-above-waste-rate 0.25
xerg audit --fail-above-waste-usd 100
xerg audit --json
```
